- Everyone tries everything, and nothing happens. To list some things: investigation, history and aracana checks found nothing, burning fire on it did nothign, splashing water did nothing, digging did nothing, throwing a shield from the sentry at it did nothing, licking it revealed it tastes like burnt ground 
- The Seekers return to the graveyard and talk to the surviving gravekeeper. They find out... nothing about the snowflake and that gravekeeper unloved wife was a witch
- The Seekers leave [[DNDTheSeekers/Locations/Vidar|Vidar]] and head towards the Dyr Mountains, [[DNDTheSeekers/Locations/Hvassfelland|Hvassfelland]]
- [[DNDTheSeekers/PlayerChars/Potjeh|Potjeh]] searching for the truth, [[DNDTheSeekers/PlayerChars/AAron|AAron]] on a quest to protect [[DNDTheSeekers/PlayerChars/Potjeh|Potjeh]], [[DNDTheSeekers/PlayerChars/Rungni|Rungni]] looking for dwarven settlements
- The seekers walked and walked and found nothing of importance, then close to the evening they stumbled upon the abandoned camp
- after [[DNDTheSeekers/PlayerChars/Taboo|Taboo's]] scouting [[DNDTheSeekers/PlayerChars/AAron|Aaron]] and [[DNDTheSeekers/PlayerChars/Potjeh|Potjeh]] investigated the camp and found some money, a ring with [[DNDTheSeekers/PlayerChars/Potjeh|Potjeh's]] birth rune, a [[DNDTheSeekers/Items/Tattered notebook, Infernal|tattered notebook with Infernal writing]] and some dragging tracks
