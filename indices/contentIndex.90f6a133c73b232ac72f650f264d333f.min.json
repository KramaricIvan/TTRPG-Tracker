Mannaz\n\t- Stralia i Ten mi se smiju, ali ja mislim da svaki pravi avanturist mora bilježiti svoje avanture.\n\t  Krenuli smo iz Nornsborga i sljedećih tjedan dana proveli putujući. Nije baš bilo puno događaja, ali Stralia je uspjela pasti s drve---~_ NE NISAM! To je Moj dnevnik Stralia. Odi se penji na drveće.\n\t  Anyway! Kupio sam dnevnik u Vidaru i sad mogu zapisivati svaki detalj naše epic avanture.\n\t  Stralia je uspjela naljutiti vlasnike obje krčme pa smo morali spavati vani na ulici. Istina je da je Vidar malo lud s tom svojom tišinom, ali u buduće ćemo samo Ten i ja razgovarati s ljudima.\n- 10. Mannaz\n\t- Čuli smo od nekog halfling lika da ima skriveni sustav špilja negdje u Dyr planinama. Meni to zvuči kao savršena avantura za nas Tres Diablos. Stralia želi da se naš party zove StraKloTen. Ten odbija prihvatiti bilokakvo ime.\n- Stranice koje prikazuju generic putovanje.\n- 14. Mannaz\n\t- Ovo je bila najluđa stvar koja se ikad ikome dogodila.\n\t  Jučer i prekjučer smo bauljali po planinama tamo gdje bi trebao biti ulaz u špilje, ali bilo ga je nemoguće naći. Već smo se odlučili vratiti u Vidar, obnoviti zalihe hrane i nastaviti u nekom zanimljivijem pravcu. Prema Freyi na primjer. Ali u tom trenutku je Ten pronašao sitni špiljski otvor. Ja kao najmanji i najtiši član Tres Diabolosa, sam išao pogledati kuda vodi i otkrio sam da je to jedan od ulaza. Nije glavni jer glavni se trebao lagano prepoznati po tome da je visok 3m i da ispred njega rastu dvije breze. Tako nam je halfling rekao. Ovo je bilo usred ničega!\n\t  Nakon moje vrlo kratke provjere terena, svi smo ušli unutra. Bilo je jako puno tunela. Nismo ih sve pretražili. Ni približno. Imali smo puno sreće. Zatekao nas je jedan veoma ružan undead i par štakora, ali smo ih uspjeli ubiti.\n\t  Zatim smo došli do dijela koji je ličio na nečiju sobu. Pretražili smo sve i pronašli zaključanu škrinju ispod kreveta. Bilo ju je teško otključati, ali to je mali problem za mene. Ja sam otključavao lokote od djetinjstva. Čim smo otvorili škrinju, prošao nas je neopisivi osjećaj jeze. Unutra je bio jedan kristal koji je blago svjetlio. Ten se skroz preplašio i odlučio da moramo izaći van iz špilje što prije. On je najstariji pa često ima zadnju riječ. Otišli smo van, no ja sam uzeo kristal sa sobom. To je sigurno vrijedno puno zlata.\n\t  Vani je Stralia uhvatila spritea. Ona je oduvijek voljela čudne ljubimce.\n- 15. Mannaz\n\t- Danas smo----~_\n\t- Stranice imaju mrlje krvi.","lastmodified":"2024-08-25T15:23:36.147532284Z","tags":null},"/DNDTheSeekers/Locations/Aronia":{"title":"Aronia","content":"\nThe Seekers know: \n- Aronia is in war with [[DNDTheSeekers/Locations/Eysjá|Eysjá]] and is considered an agressor\n","lastmodified":"2024-08-25T15:23:36.147532284Z","tags":null},"/DNDTheSeekers/Locations/Bl%C3%A1rmen-R%C3%ADki":{"title":"Blármen Ríki","content":"\nvisited in: \n[[DNDTheSeekers/Sessions/Session 0/The Seekers Session 0|S0]], [[DNDTheSeekers/Sessions/Session 1/The Seekers Session 1|S1]]\n","lastmodified":"2024-08-25T15:23:36.147532284Z","tags":null},"/DNDTheSeekers/Locations/Eysj%C3%A1":{"title":"Eysjá","content":"\nThe Seekers know: \n- [[DNDTheSeekers/Locations/Aronia|Aronia]] is in war with [[DNDTheSeekers/Locations/Eysjá|Eysjá]] and is considered an agressor","lastmodified":"2024-08-25T15:23:36.147532284Z","tags":null},"/DNDTheSeekers/Locations/Hvassfelland":{"title":"Hvassfelland","content":"\nvisited in: \n[[DNDTheSeekers/Sessions/Session 1/The Seekers Session 1|S1]]","lastmodified":"2024-08-25T15:23:36.147532284Z","tags":null},"/DNDTheSeekers/Locations/Vidar":{"title":"Vidar","content":"![ ](/DNDTheSeekers/images/VidarMapa.jpeg)\nLocation:\n- City in [[DNDTheSeekers/Locations/Blármen Ríki|Blármen Ríki]]\n\nInteresting:\n- Cradle of 'The Seekers' legend\n\nThe Seekers know about: \n- they LOVE [[DNDTheSeekers/Characters/Deity/God Vidar|Vidar]]\n- they LOVE revenge\n- they HATE loud people (unless they are in combat)\n- [[DNDTheSeekers/PlayerChars/Taboo|Taboo]] no rizz on Vidar emo sceene\n- weapon shopkeep knows Dwarven, [[DNDTheSeekers/PlayerChars/Rungni|Rungni]] and [[DNDTheSeekers/PlayerChars/AAron|Arron]] found out the hard way\n- Zombies raised by a returned sentry killed one of the gravekeepers\n- Other gravekeeper wants revenge on first gravekepper because he owed him 5gp \n- Deceased gravekeepers sister dislikes [[DNDTheSeekers/PlayerChars/þrúđr|þrúđr]] beacuse she disrespected [[DNDTheSeekers/Characters/Deity/God Vidar|Vidar]] \n\nVisited in: \n[[DNDTheSeekers/Sessions/Session 0/The Seekers Session 0|S0]], [[DNDTheSeekers/Sessions/Session 1/The Seekers Session 1|S1]]","lastmodified":"2024-08-25T15:23:36.147532284Z","tags":null},"/DNDTheSeekers/Norse-Calendar":{"title":"Norse Calendar","content":"___\n![ ](DNDTheSeekers/images/calednarrunes.png)\n___\nThe Seekers campaign:\n- Start: 15. ᛗ 3501. \n- [[DNDTheSeekers/Sessions/Session 0/The Seekers Session 0|Session 0]]\n___\nSystem: \n- 24 runes, each representing 15 days\n- 360 day long year \n- 12 months, halves having different runes\n___\nRune meanings: \n- The meaning of each rune can be summarized as follows\n- ALGIZ Protection, Defense\n- ANSUZ Odin Rune, God, Communication\n- BERKANA Femininity, Fertility, Birth\n- DAGAZ Dawn, Awakening, Awareness, Illumination, Hope\n- EHWAZ Transportation, Movement, Progress\n- EIHWAZ Balance, Reliability, Dependability\n- FEHU  Wealth, Abundance, Success\n- GEBO Gift, Balance, Generosity\n- HAGALAZ  Wrath of Nature, Being Tested\n- INGUZ, Growth, Change, Common Sense\n- ISA Clarity, Stasis, Introspection, Watching \u0026 Waiting\n- JERA A Time of peace and happiness, fruitful season\n- KENNAZ Vision, Creativity, Knowledge\n- LAGUZ ( ᛚ ) Water, Intuition, Emotions, Flow\n- MANNAZ ( ᛗ ) Humanity.

right path out of the room and stumbled upon doors with a bar window slit\n\t- upon shining some light and inspecting the doors, doors seems to be losely shut and inside the room were 50 returned sentris and a snowflake simbol\n\t- party heads back through the hall and goes to the water canal, blood of the fish was moved forward\n\t- the further they swimmed, the shallower and warmer it got\n\t- when they left the water, a 10° straight uphill hall was in front of them\n\t- hall was warmer and warmer but The Seekers continued forward until they stumbled upon a room with stalactites and stalagmites\n\t- room had very tall ceiling and many fire beatles\n\t- Potjeh tries to catch some but he fails, so the party continues, it's still getting hotter and hotter\n\t- They enter a closed room, dead end\n\t- It's around 40 °C and room has a lava pool, small alocove behind lava pool and from the right corner of the room a small pool of orange liquid dripping from the ceiling\n\t- AAron tries to melt paper with it and tires to set a few drops ablaze, nothing happens it's just a fairly viscous fluid\n\t- Taboo lets Larabonkaorochimaruvoldemortnagini Junior eat a drop, it likes it and stars getting more\n\t- Taboo then procedess to do the same, and just keep catching the drops into her mouth\n\t- Party is confused and takes a few steps back towards the lava pool\n\t- Taboo wants more and more of the liquid, AAron trying to figure out as much about it as possible, pressdigitates Taboos next bite to taste and smell like horse shit\n\t- Taboo throws a drop at him, he dodges\n\t- Taboo eats her drop and wants more, the two repeat the whole horseshit and dodging act\n\t- AAron is considering tying Taboo down, but party doesen't seem to share the sentiment\n\t- Rungni and þrúđr move closer to the lava pool and then fire beings attack\n\t- Taboo, AAron and Potjeh stay in back half of the room\n\t- Rungni, Prdr and Raksha are in front\n\t- Fire shits cast heat

frontliners\n\t- party decides to go back to the crystal cave to rest\n\t- drops taboo ate stopped dripping, AAron tries to shoot the source on the ceiling but misses and almost hits ChungaLunga Jr\n\t- when passing through room with fire beatles AARon strikes one down with ELDRITCH BLAST! while Potjeh manages to tame one\n\t- Party sleeps in the crystal room then after nothign happen when sleepiong they return to the upper level\n\t- they explore the rest of the first level, nothing happens really, taboo finds some rings and some crows are seen in the maze\n\t- upon following the last unexplored path, party runs up to a wall lined with vines\n\t- party want to go climb it, AAron first grabs onto the vines then a swarm of centepedes dropps onto his head\n\t- party dispatches of the centepides, AAron wounded\n\t- they climb up and take first left where they run into an unusually clean floor, for lulz AAron dirties it with pressdigitation as some of the pary wipe their shoes on the rocks\n\t- party sees the doors in front of the clean hall, they knock and enter\n\t- inside the room are some crates, big snowflake symbol and a figure in black\n\t- Taboo almost angers the man and works against the party but Rungni and AAron manage to push everyone out of the room and convice them and NecroGuy that AAron should stay behind and talk to him\n\t- Party sits outside and play bottle of truth\n\t- AAron talks silently with the Necro guy\n\t- after some time, and after party almost tore down the doors and barged into the room AAron exits, Necro talking nicely to him and giving him half of his halfeaten sandwich\n\t- AAron tells everyone to calm down, shut up and just follow him\n\t- Most of the group isn't really trusting AAron because he got well with the random necro dude who had a monologu about making Vidar burn with his returned sentry army\n\t- The Seekers agree to follow AAron when he show that Necro drew them a map of the rest of the cave and how to

Metadata\n\n## 1.1 Titles\n\n- Quartz requres precise title metadata\n- so if you are ever making a new page, it has to have a metadata element which you can make by encapsualting text metadata with --- --- \n- first key in metadata must be \"title:\"\n- value in \"title:\" key must be in double qoutes \" \"\n- value needs to be separated by one space to be read correctly as a value\nexample:\n```\n---\ntitle:\"example\"\n---\n\nWould push to git, but site wouldnt build\n```\n\n```\n---\ntitle: \"example\"\n---\n\nWould push to git and build\n```\n## 1.2 YAML\n\n- metadata is based on YAML \n- YAML is lowkey a standard in technical documentation today \n- it has a fun recursive name YAML stands for YAML ain't a markup language\n- so yeah, if you want to make some tag system or expand the vault a lot, try to stick to YAML syntax\n\n# 2. Images\n\n- Sort images you add to coresponding folders\n- If it's something for the campaign pages, then sort it in that campaigns image folder\n- if it's something for the notes and guides, then sort it in the notes/images folder\n- images (or any other files) must not have same names in obisdian\n\t- titles in metadata can be same (it's site only)\n\t- but for obsidian to work and for them to publish correctly all files need unique names\n\n- correct syntax for the images is \n```\n![ ](/example/images/example.png)\n\nor for obs.png in note/images\n\n![ ](/notes/images/obs.png)\n```\n\n\n# 3. Syntax\n\n- for thing to stay ordered and not smush into the same line you need to use lists\n- List syntax is just a - \n\nexample\n```\nItem1\nItem2\nItem3 \n\nwill render as \n\nItem1Item2Item3\n```\n\n```\n- Item1\n- Item2\n- Item3 \n\nwill render as \n\nItem1\nItem2\nItem3\n```\n\n# 4. CSS\n\n- you can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`.

[Github](https://github.com/)\n\u003e \t\t- Account\n\u003e \t\t- Preferable basic [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) knowledge\n\u003e - 2. Markdown editor\n\u003e \t\t- recomended/what I'm using: [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) \n\n# 1. First time/setup\n\n### 1.  [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)\n\n- download [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)\n- if you want to use it for other stuff setup it as you wish\n- for the needs of this page... just chill for now\n\n### 2. Git/hub\n\n- Make [Github account](https://github.com/) if you don't have one`\n- Once you have GitHub account ready: \n\t- ask Ivan on wapp to add you as colaborator \n\t- download and install [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) \n\t\t- why? Because console is cool  \n\t- or just use GitHub web-ui \n\t\t\t- I won't write a guide for that unless non-coding ppl want to edit this site\n\t\t\t- rest can do it intuitively, but keep in mind it has 25MB upload limit as opposed to 100MB from console\n\n\n### 3. Clone repo \n\n- Make a folder on your PC you want to clone the repo in \n- Open gitbash \n- cd to the folder you just made\n```copy\ncd C:/Users/User/.../\u003cnew folder you made\u003e\n```\n- clone the repo\n```copy\ngit clone https://github.com/KramaricIvan/TTRPG-Tracker\n```\n\n\n### 4. Link Obsidian\n\n- Open Obsidian\n ![Image](/notes/images/obs.png)\n \n\n- Pick \"Open folder as vault\"\n- Navigate to the new folder you just made\n- Navigate to the cloned repo\n- Navigate to content\n- Open TTRP-Tracker/content as a Vault \n\n### 5. Done\n\n![](notes/images/vault.png)\n\n- well not really, the setup is done\n- you can edit now, and see the content as an Obsidian Vault\n\n### 6. Commiting changes \n\n- once you are done editing, to post the changes to all other users and to the page you have to push to git\n- so just do a standard push\n- open Gitbash, cd to the repo on your PC\n```copy\ncd C:/Users/User/.../\u003cnew folder you made\u003e/TTRPG-Tracker\n```\n\n- to add all edited files to the package\n```copy\ngit add . \n```\n\n- create package\n```copy\ngit commit -m \"Commit message here\" \n```\n\n- push to git \n\u003e[!error] make sure you push to HUGO branch, not master\n\n```copy\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\n- This will promt Ivan for the confirmation and after he mergest the files\n- Hugo branch will get pushed\n- Which triggers GitAction in which master branch copies files from content in Hugo branch and parses them through html snippets and builds the new site. \n\n\n\n\n\n# 2. Updating \n\n### 1. Pull changes\n\n- before you start editng you should pull the latest version of the repo by just calling\n```copy\ncd C:/Users/User/.../\u003cYour folder\u003e/TTRPG-Tracker\n```\n\n```copy\ngit pull\n```\n\n### 2. Edit \n\n### 3. Push new changes \n\n- just do a standard push\n- open Gitbash, cd to the repo on your PC\n```copy\ncd C:/Users/User/.../\u003cnew folder you made\u003e\n```\n\n- to add all edited files to the package\n```copy\ngit add . \n```\n\n- create package\n```copy\ngit commit -m \"Commit message here\" \n```\n\n- push to git \n\u003e[!error] make sure you push to HUGO branch, not master\n\n```copy\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\n- This will promt Ivan for the confirmation and after he mergest the files\n- Hugo branch will get pushed\n- Which triggers GitAction in which master branch copies files from content in Hugo branch and parses them through html snippets and builds the new site. \n\n### 4. \"Automation\"\n- Unfortunately the process is manual, there are some extension, but extensions break the quartz\n- My only idea is to make a script that make it all 1 click instead of writing commands\n\nSo here are my two shell scripts:\n\nAutoPull.sh (pull the latest version of vault from git)\n\n```copy\n#!/bin/sh\ncd \u003cyour path to TTRPG-Tracker\u003e\ngit pull\necho Press Enter...\nread\n```\n\nAutoPush.sh (push your changes to git)\n```copy\n#!/bin/sh\ncd \u003cyour path to TTRPG-Tracker\u003e\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Autopush\"\ngit push\necho Press Enter...\nread\n```\n\n- I keep the scripts one folder behind the syncing folder so it doesen't get overwriten with other peoples paths\n- \"coder\" way would be to just have them in repo and use git-ignore, but we'll keep it dirty for now, because it's easier\n\n### 5. There could be a solution \n- of making an app that starts the Obsidian app and then just commits all the changes then pushes them once the app is closed or every X interval of time\n- if someone is willing to make it, be my gust\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-08-25T15:23:36.195532601Z","tags":null},"/notes/config":{"title":"Configuration","content":"\n## Configuration\nQuartz is designed to be extremely configurable. You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to render callouts\nenableCallouts: true\n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2024-08-25T15:23:36.195532601Z","tags":null}}
